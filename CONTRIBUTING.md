## How to help

We need contributors to a wide variety of things for kurly.  Examples include:

    * Documentation - if you see a gap or error in any docs, please consider addressing this
    * Test coverage - testing is something we're struggling with for kurly right now, and this needs all the help it can get
    * Packaging - if you're able and willing to be a long-term maintainer of a particular package for your distribution or OS of course, please get in touch
    * Bug fixes - please peruse the [GitHub Issues List]((https://github.com/davidjpeacock/kurly/issues); in particular, watch out for the tags 'help wanted', and 'good first issue'
    * Features - we welcome features too - please feel free to discuss anything in advance on our IRC channel [#kurly](irc://chat.freenode.net/kurly) in order to coordinate efforts

## Guidelines

    * We like small atomic commits.  Please structure your commits such that a single commit containing working code comes in as a pull request nice and clean; if you have multiple working commits please rebase your branch first before sending the pull request
    * Commit messages must not be one-liners; structure them with a concise summary on the first line, followed by a multiline description of the purpose of the commit.  E.g.
    ```
    add whizbang doohickey

    This commit adds functionality to help with things
    to do with the other thing that we also worked on before
    ```
    * Make use of [GitHub keywords](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/) in your commit messages to automatically link pull requests to issues

Thanks,
David Peacock
